wow i totally forgot i had written stuff here. <br><br>

opened this space now, to write my opinions and questions <br><br>

what is kneeling down? maybe it helps keep your focus. i think it might help me pray for longer than 2 sentences at least, if i try. <br><br>

so i tried <br><br>

i said <br><br>

"experiment Lord. experiment." <br><br>

and knelt down like i used to do as a kid during prayers. <br><br>

this time I only prayed in the spirit. maybe for 3 minutes. <br><br>

i heard in my spirit 'change' 'change' <br><br>

it could have meant to change the seat where i seek God from <br><br>

I realize in my spirit that, since Jesus did the kneeling for me in that garden, i need no longer kneel. <br><br>

kneeling. is. done. <br><br>

but yea as i speculated, it helped me 'focus', setting a new high score of authentic praying in tongues session 'with focus'. <br><br>

the other times i do it too, but those are distracted ones and are more realistic, close to being humane and still holding a relationship with Jesus - just a spirit connection. <br><br>

so you get to decide which one is more closer to a father child relationship. <br><br>

You see Jesus sits next to God in the majestic chair of Heaven!<br><br> I can't imagine how majestic it would look like. He was loved by God. <br><br>But to teach us this truth of creation that we no longer need to kneel because 

<li><dl>first, we are made in His Image.</dl>
<li><dl>Second, God used to walk with men.</dl> 

But, The Liar separated men from God. <br><br> 

But the Beloved now, took the seat of separation, kneeling down before His own King-Dad. choosing to take the seat of abandonment and sorrow and pleading His Own Dad.<br><BR> So that you and I today will know that Jesus went through the Sorrows we go through, He knows to deal with our sorrows too! <br><br>He felt every bit of abandonment, so He totally knows what you in your state of abandonment require.<br><br> He is fully capable of loving you. <br><br> He knelt down so You do not want to kneel in your sorrows and drown in them, instead You take the majestic seat next to Jesus. And rest with confidence. without guilt. <br><br> Remember the verse? 'For today, now, you shall be in Heaven with me.' Today. Today. Right Now. Right Now as you SEE JESUS HUNG ON CROSS BEARING ALL THE WEIGHT OF YOUR BURDENS. <br><BR>You shall take the royal seat, for He took the kneeling ground. AMENNNNNNN <br><br>


ok but, kneeling down actually made me write. i mean i only knelt down with hopes of praying, but little did i know it made me proceed with my purpose! <br><br>

I want you to know, it's not the kneeling down that gave me answers, but my warfare in the spirit to somehow 'PRAY' that's showing me it's not the prayer that the world needs from me, in fact it's not what even I need from myself, it is my writings that the whole entirety of the universe needs From Me ! <br><BR> duh- not my confidence skyrocketting <br><BR>

Ok Lord, I.... ehh no need of formalities. God Just wants to rush to business.  (was about to write, yea lord i obey.... but the spirit knows it ain't real and it ain't authentic when i pretend.)<br><br>
